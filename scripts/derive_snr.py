"""Where the disclosure signal-to-noise ratio comes from, and what moves it.

The paper argues that widening the disclosure window is a lever for about four
minutes and then stops being one, and that the quantity left over is the number
of firms in the aggregate. Both statements are arithmetic on constants that are
already in the engine and the mechanism, so this script derives them rather than
measuring them --- and checks the one number it can check, the noise scale, against
the value the disclosure runs actually used.
