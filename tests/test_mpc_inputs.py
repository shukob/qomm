"""No computing node holds a whole request or a whole policy.

This is the property the design has always claimed and the code did not have:
the request was read with `get_input_from(0)` and each maker's policy with
`get_input_from(i % N_PARTIES)`, so node 0 held the request --- `is_real`
included --- and one node held each policy in the clear. The circuit was
therefore a benchmark of party-supplied inputs, not of a venue that hides the
request from the people running it.

Checking it here rather than reading the generator is deliberate. The property
is about what ends up in `Player-Data/Input-P*-0`, which is the thing an
operator can actually look at, so that is what the tests read.

# These shares are additive, so a node that lies about its share shifts the sum
# and the circuit computes on a request nobody sent. Stopping that needs an
# input-consistency check inside the protocol and there is not one here. What
# there is, is the same thing the slot receipts give elsewhere: the dealt value
# is signed, so a node that put in a different one can be shown to have done it.
