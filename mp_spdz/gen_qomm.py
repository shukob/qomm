"""Generate the QOMM query-oblivious quote circuit and its MP-SPDZ inputs.

The circuit implements the pricing model defined in
``papers/kyc_private_clob_defmi/private_rfq_dex_project_proposal.md``:

    q_{i,t} = P_i(x, s_{i,t}, m_t)

Market makers pre-register a secret price policy; the user secret-shares the
request. No market maker ever receives the request itself, so a losing market
maker does not learn that a request existed.

Layer structure (this is the point of the design):

    layer 1  policy arithmetic for all M market makers   -- SIMD, depth 1
    layer 2  eligibility gates for all M                 -- SIMD, depth 1
    layer 3  best-quote selection                        -- binary tree, depth log2(M)

Everything is integer arithmetic on price ticks and lots; no secret division.
