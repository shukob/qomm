"""Signed per-slot receipts and the evidence that convicts a misbehaving node.

The design follows the three kinds of audit the Issue separates.

    computation      every slot carries a result digest that a proof commits to
    equivocation     two signatures by one node for one slot, over different
                     digests, are self-contained evidence anyone can check
    unresponsiveness  a slot deadline passes with fewer receipts than required

Nothing here reveals whether a slot carried a real request. A receipt is emitted
for every slot on the fixed schedule, and its contents are digests, so a dummy
slot and a real slot are indistinguishable from the receipt alone. That is the
property the Issue calls query-oblivious auditability, and it is why the
liveness rule can be "a receipt from every node, every slot": without it,
"the node did not answer" is not something a third party can check.
