//! Compile the C++ shim against MP-SPDZ's headers and link its shared library.
//!
//! MP-SPDZ is not vendored and not built here. It is a large C++ tree with its
//! own dependencies (GMP, libsodium, OpenSSL, Boost) and its own build; asking
//! cargo to drive that would put a forty-minute C++ build behind every `cargo
//! check`. Instead the crate points at an existing checkout through
//! `MP_SPDZ_ROOT`, and compiles without the engine when that is unset --- so the
//! workspace still builds on a machine that has no MP-SPDZ, which is most of
//! them.
//!
//! The flags are not written down here. They are asked of MP-SPDZ's own
//! `CONFIG`, because several of them change the layout of the types the shim
//! passes across the boundary: `-DGFP_MOD_SZ=4` sets how many limbs a field
//! element has, `-DUSE_GF2N_LONG` which binary field is compiled in. A shim
//! built without them links against `libSPDZ` without complaint and then reads
//! the wrong bytes out of every object it is handed --- which shows up as a
//! segmentation fault in all seven parties at once, and not as a build error.
//! Reading the flags from the same file the engine's own objects were built
//! from is what makes that class of failure impossible rather than merely
//! unlikely.
