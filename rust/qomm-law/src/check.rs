//! What the compiler refuses, which is the whole of its value.
//!
//! Three refusals, and each exists because the failure it catches is one that
//! prose leaves invisible.
//!
//! **An obligation with nothing discharging it and no note saying why.** In a
//! table that reads as a blank cell and nobody notices. Here it does not build.
//!
//! **A clause nobody has looked at inside its own stated interval.** Answering
//! from it would be answering with confidence from a rule that may have
//! changed, which is worse than not answering. Compiling for a date past the
//! review window refuses and names the article --- so following a rule change
//! immediately is a build that stops rather than an intention somebody holds.
//!
//! **Evidence that covers nothing.** Not fatal, because a module can be added
//! before the obligation it will discharge is written down, but it is reported,
//! because the usual cause is that the obligation was renamed on one side.
