//! A small language for the rules a deployment has to satisfy.
//!
//! `REGULATION.md` scores five jurisdictions against three requirements and
//! lists, in prose, which evidence discharges which obligation. Prose is the
//! wrong container for it, for three reasons that have nothing to do with
//! elegance.
//!
//! **A citation and a check drift apart silently.** A table saying "PTS
//! authorisation, FIEA art. 30" and a codebase emitting a slot receipt are two
//! artefacts nobody compares. Here an obligation names the evidence that
//! discharges it and the compiler refuses a rule base where one does not ---
//! so the correspondence is one to one because it fails to build otherwise.
//!
//! **A rule that nobody has looked at recently is worse than no rule**, because
//! it is answered with confidence. Every clause carries when it was last
//! reviewed and how often it must be; compiling for a date past that refuses
//! and names the clause. Immediate following of a rule change is not a promise
//! anybody keeps by intending to --- it is a build that stops.
//!
//! **And a verdict without its clause is an opinion.** Every verdict here
//! carries the article it came from, so the output is a citation list rather
//! than an assertion.
//!
//! What this is not: legal advice, and not a claim that the rules encoded are
//! current. It is a place to put them where being out of date is loud.
