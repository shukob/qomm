//! Registered digests, so a substituted rule or circuit is detectable.
//!
//! The design asks that an approved rule form and its circuit digest be
//! registered, with only the secret parameters replaceable afterwards. The
//! language makes that a one-line property: the digest covers the canonical
//! source, the declared bounds and the emitted circuit, but not the values.
//! Swapping a parameter keeps the digest; swapping the rule does not.
//!
//! That covers the rule and stops there, which is the half that was missing.
//! What the computing nodes execute is not a rule --- it is a program emitted
//! from one and then compiled --- so a node holding the approved digest can still
//! compile something else and the registry would never know. A second digest
//! therefore covers the emitted program text, and the two are registered
//! together with the circuit shape they belong to. Approving a rule and running
//! a different circuit now requires the shape or the program to differ, and both
//! are checked before the compiler is invoked rather than after the answers are
//! out.
//!
//! Deliberately not claimed: this binds the program text the nodes were given,
//! not the bytecode their compiler produced.
