//! Three ways of telling the market something, compared by the study.
//!
//! - **none** — only the counterparties see the firm price.
//! - **threshold** — an exact statement: at least K independent makers can fill
//!   at least V lots inside a band around the reference mid. No noise, but the
//!   statement is suppressed when it is false.
//! - **dp** — entity-clipped statistics released every window with discrete
//!   Laplace noise and a per-entity continual-observation budget.
//!
//! The DP mechanism uses entity-level adjacency: two datasets differ by removing
//! every request, quote, update and trade made by one legal entity. That is the
//! unit the design protects, and it is why the sensitivity is a per-entity clip
//! rather than a per-record bound --- which turns out to decide what the
//! mechanism can and cannot publish.
