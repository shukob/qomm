"""Slot-batching relays, one per computing node.

Each relay holds every frame it receives until the slot boundary, shuffles the
batch, and only then forwards it to its node. Two properties follow.

    origin hiding   the node sees a shuffled batch, so the order in which frames
                    arrive at the node carries nothing about who sent them
    single-share    a relay carries one additive share, which is uniform on its
                    own, so a relay that reads everything it forwards still
                    learns nothing about the request

A relay colluding with its own node breaks the second property for that share
alone; all seven would have to collude to reconstruct a request. That is the
same threshold the rest of the design assumes, and it is stated rather than
engineered away.
